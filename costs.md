# Cost benchmark: studio mirror vs hardware

Constant comparison for "why would you spend so much on hardware (3 cameras we supply)".

## Wall-to-wall studio mirror (one wall)

Typical setup: one long mirror wall, e.g. 6'×8' (48 sq ft) up to full wall (e.g. 20'×8' = 160 sq ft).

| Scenario | Installed cost |
|----------|----------------|
| Low (flat-rate / discount installer) | $500–700 (single 6'×8' wall) |
| Typical (local glass / gym-mirror companies) | $1,200–$3,000 per wall |
| Large / full wall (20+ sq ft) | $700–$2,000+; often $2,000–$4,000+ |

## Per square foot

- **Material:** $5–30/sq ft (standard glass); custom/specialty $30–100+/sq ft
- **Labor:** ~$9–13/sq ft or $50–100/hr
- **Total installed:** ~$20–50/sq ft for a standard studio mirror wall

## One number to use

**A standard studio mirror wall usually runs about $1,500–$3,000 installed.**

Use **$2,000** as a simple, defensible midpoint for "one mirror wall" in sales and marketing.

## Why this works as a comparison

Studios already budget $1,500–$3,000+ for a single mirror wall (one view, no analytics, no replay). That anchors "why spend on 3 cameras?" against a cost they already know: *"A single mirror wall is often $2,000+ installed—we're in the same ballpark for 3 cameras and give you multiple angles, recording, and feedback."*
