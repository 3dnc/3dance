## What studios actually spend

### Operating costs (monthly)

| Category | Range | Source note |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Total monthly operating** | $20,000–$25,000 | Financial Models Lab, dance studio running costs 2026 |
| **Rent** | $5,000–$12,000/mo | Largest fixed cost |
| **Payroll / wages** | $11,000–$400,000/year (size-dependent) | Single biggest expense category |
| **Marketing & advertising** | ~8% of revenue; e.g. $2,896–$6,000/mo | Variable; often 8% of revenue |
| **Software (scheduling, CRM, payments)** | $300–$1,200/mo | Recurring SaaS |
| **Insurance** | ~$250/mo + music licensing (~10% of revenue) | Base liability; dance often classified higher risk |
| **Utilities** | ~$800/mo | Electricity, water, HVAC |
| **Cleaning & maintenance** | $600–$700/mo | |

### One-time / capital

| Item | Typical cost | Source |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **One mirror wall (installed)** | $1,500–$3,000 (~$2,000 midpoint) | See costs.md; Angi, The Mirror Company, StudioGrowth / Fab Glass |

### Retention vs acquisition

| Metric | Value | Source note |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Acquire vs retain** | 5–7× more expensive to acquire a new student than to keep one | ClassManager, DSOA retention content |
| **Broader business** | 5–25× (retention cheaper than acquisition) | ChurnKey, GTM8020 CAC benchmarks |
| **Retention impact on profit** | 5% improvement in retention → 25–95% profit increase | Genesys Growth CAC/retention stats |

### Per-student value

| Metric | Range | Source note |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Monthly tuition (one class)** | ~$70–$75/mo (one-hour class); $40–$160 by market | Studio Director, Ensembles 2025–26 |
| **Annual (one class/week)** | ~$840–$900 tuition only | Derived from monthly |
| **Lifetime value (classes only)** | ~$7,200 (e.g. $12/week × 40 weeks × 15 years) | DSOA “What Is One New Student Worth” |
| **Lifetime value (with ancillaries)** | $20,000–$30,000 per student (one class/week) | DSOA; includes costumes, recitals, camps, etc. |
| **Preschool / high-LTV segment** | Can exceed $40,000 per student | Dance Motion Marketing |

### Liability and injury

| Metric | Value | Source note |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Average small business liability claim** | $97,200 (up 18% since 2022) | PR Newswire / insurer data |
| **Defend + settle (general liability)** | Often >$75,000 | Business Insurance USA |
| **Settlement ranges** | Minor: $10K–$50K; moderate: $75K–$500K; severe: $500K–$2M+ | Premises/slip-fall settlement analyses (e.g. Richman Law) |
| **Underinsurance** | 1 in 3 small businesses lack adequate coverage for current claim levels | PR Newswire |
| **Documentation** | Incident reports (who, when, supervising instructor, description) critical for claims | Dance studio incident report / insurance FAQs |

Professional dance injury epidemiology (e.g. ballet, modern) documents high time-loss injury rates but does not publish studio-level cost per incident; small business liability averages are the best proxy for “cost of one claim.”

## Where the system can save money or reduce risk

### 1. Hardware vs mirror (already in costs.md)

- Studios already spend **$1,500–$3,000** for one mirror wall (one view, no replay, no analytics).
- A 3-camera setup in the same range delivers multiple angles, recording, and live 3D feedback. Frame as: same order of investment as a core studio asset, with more capability.

### 2. Retention (progress visibility, trust, engagement)

- **Data:** Acquiring a new student costs **5–7×** more than retaining one; LTV with ancillaries **$20K–$30K** (up to **$40K+** for high-value segments).
- **Mechanism:** Progress clips and multi-angle views give parents clear, professional visibility → stronger trust and engagement → better retention.
- **Conservative framing:** Keeping even **2–3 students per year** who would have left (e.g. $20K LTV each) = **$40K–$60K** in preserved revenue; cost to replace them at 5–7× acquisition cost would be much higher. Don’t claim a single “we save $X” number; use “preserve revenue” and “avoid 5–7× acquisition cost for every student you keep.”

### 3. Liability and injury (documentation + prevention)

- **Data:** Average liability claim **~$97,200**; defend + settle often **>$75,000**; many studios underinsured.
- **Mechanism:** Timestamped 3D and multiple angles support incident documentation; earlier visibility into form/load can support injury-risk management (alignment, load management).
- **Conservative framing:** “One avoided claim can be six figures. Objective, multi-angle documentation supports incident reports and insurance.” Do not promise a specific dollar savings; emphasize risk reduction and documentation quality.

### 4. Marketing (content from existing rehearsal)

- **Data:** Studios spend **~8% of revenue** on marketing (e.g. **$2,896–$6,000/mo**); video is essential for engagement; generic content underperforms.
- **Mechanism:** Export camera-ready angles and 3D-style views from regular rehearsals/classes → more authentic content without a separate video shoot.
- **Conservative framing:** “Turn rehearsal into marketing content without a separate production budget.” No industry-wide number for “video production spend” for studios; avoid claiming a specific $ saved; focus on “use what you already do.”

### 5. Load management and injury risk

- **Data:** Injury risk management (load management, adaptation of choreography) is recommended for studios; professional dance data shows significant time-loss injury rates.
- **Mechanism:** 3D view of the room and participants can support awareness of repetition and load distribution; better visibility for instructors to adapt class design.
- **Conservative framing:** “Support load management and injury-risk practices with a clear view of the room and movement.” No dollar figure; position as risk and wellness support.

## One-page summary for sales/marketing

- **Operating context:** Studios run **$20K–$25K/month** in costs; payroll and rent dominate; marketing ~**8% of revenue**.
- **Hardware:** In the same range as **one mirror wall** (**~$2,000** installed)—same ballpark, more capability.
- **Retention:** Keeping students is **5–7×** cheaper than acquiring them; LTV **$20K–$30K+** per student. Progress visibility and trust support retention → preserved revenue and avoided acquisition cost.
- **Liability:** Average claim **~$97K**; documentation and prevention matter. Multi-angle, timestamped 3D supports incident reports and risk management.
- **Marketing:** Use rehearsal and class as content; no need to invent a “video production savings” number—frame as turning existing activity into assets.

All figures above are from public industry and small-business sources; adjust wording for compliance (no guaranteed savings; risk reduction and capability only where appropriate).
